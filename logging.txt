The lua landsacape of logging libraries could be better. 

I miss the python one. 
Let's brainstorm a slightly smaller one, but that would do most of the things.


From first principles: 

- the main egine that goes through messages, filter which loggers whould
  receive it then ran through handlers and formatters .

- two simple handlers: streamout and file
- two simple formatters  : color and plain text
- hability to do log level per combo, including partial package path, like
  engine.gas.* -> 

I'm algo thinking that handlers, formatters, all of these could just as well be
functions with a defined signatures, no need for objects here

Are these too much? to little?
