Understanding lual


If you're familiar with logging libs, nothing here should be a surprise, in
which case just read the renaming footnotes at the end of this file.

Lual strives to find a good balance between simplicity and flexibility, between
pre established expectations and coherence. As such it probably nags your
senses at places.


The Logging Pipeline

When you code runs: 

    logger.debug("Hey guys, I'm debugging")

This is what happens: 

    1. The main logger is called. 
    2. It replaces the debug call with a log call and appends the level
       and message to the log queue. (those are just shortcuts to log)
    3. This triggers the ingest pieline.
        a. The first question is: which (if any) of your loggers should see the
        message? 
        b. It goes through loggers, finds the one you that cares about this level
        and that shares a name (if you haven't changed much it will hit your
        root logger).
