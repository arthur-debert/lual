Lual: A lua logger paying homage to python's stdlib logger.

Lual is a focused but powerful and flexible logging library for lua. 
Modeled after Python's standard library logger, it provides a simple interface
for logging messages at different severity levels, with named loggers , rich
dispatching and customizable handlers and formatters.

It borrows from Python but also leverages Lua's strengths, hence the entire
design is done over functions and tables. 

It comes with a  spartan collection of handlers (console ; file ) and
formatters (plaintext; colored ; json) but one can register custom functions
for these roles with ease.

It supports Lua5.1+ and LuaJIT, has a decent test coverage and hopefully will
make your lifer fuller (of letters, at least).


    -- Lual is available as a LuaRocks module, so you can install it with:

        luarocks install lual

    -- shell





    --  A very minimal example: 

        local logger = require "lual.logger"

        logger.setLevel("DEBUG") -- set the global log level
        logger.debug("This is a debug message")

    --  lua 

Lual aims to fill the gap between very minimal loggers and the full l4j ones. 


Let me know how it works for your.
